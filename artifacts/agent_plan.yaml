status: critical
findings:
  - drift_overall: true
  - pr_auc_drop_pct: 0.5
actions:
  - open_incident
  - trigger_retraining
rationale: >
  Overall data drift is detected, and the PR-AUC has dropped by 0.5% against the 7-day median.  This is a critical situation as the overall data drift is true, and a drop in PR-AUC exceeds the threshold.  Opening an incident and triggering retraining are necessary actions.
